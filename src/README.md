TinyStory 
===================================
This is an attempt to write a simple program in C++ which takes information from a tagged file, 
and converts it to a small story book generated in html and javascript. 

The aim is to provide people with a simple interface to ease them in creating interactive stories. 

In the future, maybe Qt will be used in order to provide a simple interface for even easier use!
